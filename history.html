                        From about the year 970 comes the first lengthy work of fiction in Japanese, Utsubo Monogatari (The Tale of the Hollow Tree),
                        which includes this passage: "A tree that is left growing in its natural state is a crude thing. It is only when it is kept
                        close to human beings who fashion it with loving care that its shape and style acquire the ability to move one." The idea,
                        therefore, was already established by this time that natural beauty becomes true beauty only when modified in accordance
                        with a human ideal.

                        In the medieval period, recognizable bonsai began to appear in handscroll paintings like the Ippen shonin eden (1299).
                        Saigyo Monogatari Emaki was the earliest known scroll to depict dwarfed potted trees in Japan. It dates from the year 1195,
                        in the Kamakura period. Wooden tray and dish-like pots with dwarf landscapes on modern-looking wooden shelf/benches are shown
                        in the 1309 Kasuga-gongen-genki scroll. These novelties show off the owner's wealth and were probably exotics imported from China.

                        Chinese Chan Buddhist monks also came over to teach at Japan's monasteries, and one of the monks' activities was to introduce political
                        leaders of the day to the various arts of miniature landscapes as ideal accomplishments for men of taste and learning.
                    </p>

                        From about the year 706 AD comes the tomb paintings for Crown Prince Zhang Huai which included depictions of two
                        ladies-in-waiting offering miniature rockery landscapes with small plants in shallow dishes. By this time there were the
                        earliest written descriptions of these pun wan â€“ tray playthings. As the creation and care of these was somewhat already
                        advanced, the maturation of the art had taken place (but its documentation has not yet been discovered by us).
